# Robust vessel segmentation using Dynamic 4D-CTA 

This repository contains code for our paper on training robust vessel segmentation models using Dynamic 4D-CTA data. For now, we provide code for inference using models trained on TopCoW, VesselVerse, and our DynaVessel dataset, as well as evaluation scripts and visualization tools. The model trained on DynaVessel is subject to the specified license in the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 file; models trained on other datasets are subject to the licenses of those datasets.

We aim to release the training and evaluation partitions of DynaVessel in the short term, but it depends obtaining institutional approval from the hospital network from which we sourced the data. 

## Running inference

Please download the pretrained models from Google Drive: [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uFTrSajk2oAx4LHctZB_0cg98Ubo1QJ-&usp=drive_fs)

(More detailed instructions will be posted after the MICCAI deadline on Feb 26, apologies!)
